How to create a new portable Windows distribution of OpenSlides:
----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Install Python 3.3+ and Setuptools
   Follow the instructions in the README, section III (Windows installation), step 1.


2. Install OpenSlides 2.x package with all requirements:

       pip install openslides-2.x.tar.gz


3. Install OpenSlides-GUI package with all requirements:

       pip install openslides-gui-1.x.tar.gz


4. Install pywin32 for your Python version:
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/

   Pywin32 is used to update the version resource of the prebuild openslides.exe.
   It is not strictly required but at least for published releases it is highly advisable.


5. Run in the main directory of the OpenSlides-portable checkout:

       python make_portable.py


=> The portable OpenSlides distribution is created as a zip archive in
   the 'dist' directory.


NOTE: Creating the portable Windows distribution of OpenSlides is not possible
if Python is installed in 64-bit(!) version.
