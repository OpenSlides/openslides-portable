How to create a new portable Windows distribution of OpenSlides:
----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Install Python 2.7.x and Setuptools
   Follow the instructions in the README, section III (Windows installation), step 1.


2. Install all required python packages from requirements_production.txt:
   (Note: You have to use 'easy_install -Z $PACKAGENAME')

       python install-requirements.py


3. Install pywin32 from binary installer:
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build%20219/pywin32-219.win32-py2.7.exe/download

   Pywin32 is used to update the version resource of the prebuild openslides.exe.
   It is not strictly required but at least for published releases it is highly advisable.


4. Install wxPython from binary installer:
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxpython/files/wxPython/2.8.12.1/wxPython2.8-win32-unicode-2.8.12.1-py27.exe/download

   WxPython is required to build the OpenSlides GUI frontend.


5. Run in the main directory of the OpenSlides checkout:

       python extras\win32-portable\prepare_portable.py


=> The portable OpenSlides distribution is created as a zip archive in
   the 'dist' directory of OpenSlides checkout.


NOTE: Creating the portable Windows distribution of OpenSlides is not possible
if Python is installed in 64-bit(!) version.
