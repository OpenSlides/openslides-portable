=====================
 OpenSlides Portable
=====================

Overview
========

Scripts to build a portable version of OpenSlides for Windows. Other
plattforms (Mac OS X, Linux) are planned for the future.


Requirements
============

- `OpenSlides <https://github.com/OpenSlides/OpenSlides/>`_ 2.x
- `OpenSlides-GUI <https://github.com/OpenSlides/openslides-gui/>`_


Build a Windows portable Version
================================

This is an instruction to create a portable Windows distribution of OpenSlides.

1. Install Python 3.3+ and Setuptools

   Follow the instructions in the README of OpenSlides.


2. Install OpenSlides 2.x package with all requirements::

    $ pip install openslides-2.x.tar.gz


3. Install OpenSlides-GUI package with all requirements::

    $ pip install openslides-gui-1.x.tar.gz


4. Install pywin32 for your Python version from:

   http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/

   Pywin32 is used to update the version resource of the prebuild openslides.exe.
   It is not strictly required but at least for published releases it is highly advisable.


5. Run::

    $ python make_portable.py


The portable OpenSlides distribution is created as a zip archive in the 'dist' directory.

NOTE: Creating the portable Windows distribution of OpenSlides is not possible if Python
is installed in 64-bit(!) version.
